In my opinion, there many uses of drones that are important for the society, but while in most cases they could be replaced by something else, the one use they really shine in and probably one of some in which the can't be replaced can't be replaced is specialized firefigthing. Drones are unmatched when it comes to assisting human with extinguishing remotely any type and size of fire. They can provide infomations about the scale of the disaster, search for the injured and even extinguish the fire themselves.
