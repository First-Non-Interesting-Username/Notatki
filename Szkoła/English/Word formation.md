Praca domowa: Zadania 4 i 8/20 in netbooks

4/20:

In my opinion AI, same as every technological advacement in the past will make the world a better place in the future. Extrapolation aside, there are areas of our life AI can already improve, like basic problem solving, decision making and many other boring things that nobody want to do. 

8/20

A world where people are indistinguishable from non sentient beings would be an interesting place, or would it be <vsauce theme>. It's hard to guess how people would behave in such world. Without knowing if the truth of the world is known and who controls the robots, we can't draw any meaningfull conclusions. It may seem I'm avoiding to answer, but that's not the case here. I just had to disclaim that just the background of such world is really unclear and complicated, not even starting to talk about the subject. For the said subject: A such world would be literally the same as a current world, because of the fact the robots are indistinguishable from humans in their nature, because if they were distinguishable from humans, this would be a completely different hypothetical. Sure, some people wouldn't want to live in such world, but if they want to participate in society, they have to live with the robots. We already live in a such world.
