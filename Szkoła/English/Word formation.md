Praca domowa: Zadania 4 i 8/20 in netbooks

4/20:

In my opinion AI, same as every technological advacement in the past will make the world a better place in the future. Extrapolation aside, there are areas of our life AI can already improve, like basic problem solving, decision making and many other boring things that nobody want to do. 

8/20

A world where people are indistinguishable from non sentient beings would be an interesting place to say at least. It's hard to tell if  We already live in a such world.
