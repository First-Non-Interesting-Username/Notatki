I don't have a fashion icon. This concept is doesn't really align with my views of fashion. But, if I had to choose, my fashion icon would be someone like Steve Jobs, someone who has so much authority that people don't really care how he looks. Having said that, I have to describe the photo of him I got here.

On the photo he is wearing plain black sweater and slightly worn blue jeans. He is also wearing round glasses with slim metal frames. His outfit is simple, casual and formal, all at the same time.
